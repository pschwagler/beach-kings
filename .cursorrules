# Rules for codebase
- All methods should aim to be DRY, refactored, and professional / production ready
- All methods should be well-documented with docstrings
- All methods should be well-tested with unit tests

App Architecture Overview
-------------------------

This project is a modern, full-stack web application structured with a monorepo and leverages a Makefile to simplify common operations for development, testing, and deployment. The following overview should help agents and developers understand how to work with, build, and run the application.

1. **Monorepo Structure (Turborepo)**
   - The codebase uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) to organize multiple apps and packages under a single repository.
   - Apps (backend, frontend) and packages (shared libraries, utilities) reside in their respective subdirectories.

2. **Backend Services**
   - Located in `apps/backend/`.
   - Python async service, typically using FastAPI and PostgreSQL (async).
   - Runs via Docker for development and in production

3. **Frontend**
   - Located under `apps/frontend/` (React, possibly with Next.js).
   - Managed by Turborepo tasks, npm/yarn scripts, and Makefile shorthands.

4. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL service orchestrated via Docker Compose.
   - Migrations run automatically on system startup (FastApi lifespan)

5. **Dockerized Development**
   - Docker Compose manages containers for backend, frontend, db, workers, etc.

6. **Testing**
   - Unit and integration tests are run per workspace/package via `turbo`, native runners, or Makefile short-hands.
   - **Run all tests:** `make test`
   - Or, for more control per package, use `turbo run test` or like `cd apps/backend && pytest`
   - ** End-to-End Tests: ** Playwright tests located in `apps/web/tests/e2e/` - run with `cd apps/web && npm run test:e2e` 

8. **Shared Libraries**
   - Found under `packages/` or `libs/` directory.
   - Used for shared domain logic, types, and utilities.
